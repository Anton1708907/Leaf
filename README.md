# 🌿Leaf – earn while you chill

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

Leaf is a decentralized platform that lets you rent out your GPU when you’re not using it. And while you're at it, you play a tiny game where a tree grows and leaves fall 🍃🌳

⚙️ How it works

👤 For everyday users:
- Install the Leaf App on your PC
- Set your preferences (like "only at night" or "use 50% power")
- Your idle GPU is rented out automatically
- You earn tokens for every active minute

💡 Passive income, with a fun twist

🎮 While it runs, you play:
A tree grows on your screen as your GPU works

Leaves fall — you catch them

Get extra bonuses and grow unique trees!
